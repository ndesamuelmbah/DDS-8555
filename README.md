# DDS-8555 - Predictive Analysis

This repository contains my assignments for the DDS-8555 - Predictive Analysis course, a PhD-level course in the Data Science program.  The purpose of this repository is to make my work easily accessible to the professor for grading and review.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by assignment, with each assignment residing in its own directory.  This structure allows for clear organization and easy navigation. The assignements are grouped into folders named with the prefix *Week* concatenated with the suffix *N* where N is the week in which the assignment is due.
Each Week may have many files depending on the activity due that week. Most likely to be present files are a python jupyter notebook (`ipynb`) file and a word document summarizing what was done during that week. A knitted pdf file of the `ipynb` file may also be present.

## How to View My Work

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/ndesamuelmbah/DDS-8555.git`
2.  Navigate to the specific assignment and problem directory you are interested in.
3.  Open the `*.pdf` file to review the assignment write-up.
4.  Examine the code within the `ipynb` file to understand the implementation details.  The code files are named based on a format provided by the school

## Additional Notes

*   All code is documented with comments to explain the logic and functionality.
*   The required libraries and dependencies for running the code are listed at the beginning of each code file.
*   I have made every effort to ensure that the code is reproducible and the results are clearly presented in the report.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
